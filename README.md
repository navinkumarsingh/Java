# Java Programming for SDET - Learning & Practice

This repository is a comprehensive record of my self-driven journey to master Java for SDET roles, inspired by courses 
from Pavan Kumar and Abdul Bari, and enriched by my own research and hands-on practice.

## Highlights

- **Thorough coverage of Java fundamentals:** **variables, data types, operators, control statements, loops, methods, 
  arrays, strings, object-oriented programming (OOPs), classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, 
  encapsulation, interfaces, exception handling, collections (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`), file handling, and 
  properties files**—each reinforced with practical assignments.
- **All code is self-written, tested, and explained**—demonstrating my commitment to learning by doing.
- **Special focus on Arrays & Strings:** a dedicated folder with curated programs, solutions, and detailed explanations.
- **Well-organized structure:** topics progress from basics to advanced, with clear navigation, theory, and code samples.
- **Includes file handling and properties file examples** relevant for automation and real SDET scenarios.
- **This repository also contains thorough notes for each and every topic, and every line of code is accompanied by detailed explanations of the logic being used.**
