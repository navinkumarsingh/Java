Object type of an Array
So far we understood one definition about Array. Array is a collection of elements or collection of values of
same data type that is homogeneous data means same data type values.

If we create an integer array we have to store only integer.
If we create double array we can store only double.
If we create array as String we can store only Strings.

But if we want to store heterogeneous data that means if we want to store different type of data in Array how that is
possible.

So this is also possible but that is not recommended actually. But if we have different type of data then we can
directly go with ArrayList. ArrayList is one of the collection type, so that is preferred. Most of the times.

But we can also use array to store different type of data but this is unofficial normally we don't use this.
But if in Interview if anybody ask you can store heterogeneous data in Array. We can say Yes.
By using Object Array we can do that.

Explanation:
So if we want to store heterogeneous data in Array it shouldn't be any Specific datatype.
Ex: int a[] = {100,10.5,'A',"WELCOME", true}; - This is wrong. If datatype is 'int' or any specific datatype, it's not allowed.

So, If we want to store heterogeneous data in an array variable that variable should be Object type of variable.

What is an Object: Object is an predefined class in java just like a String. in String 'S' is a capital letter right.
So just like a String, Object is also one of the type or one of the class in java is a root class actually all other
classes are derived from the same root object class.So Object is a Super class/Root class of all predefined classes in
java.

So, if we want to store heterogeneous type of data. the array type should be Object.
Object a[] ={100,10.5,'A',"WELCOME",true};

So we will see some example.
If we create int variable we can store only number.  -> int a=10
If we create double or float we can store only decimal number. -> double d=10.5
If we create char variable we can store only char variable.  -> char c ='A'
If we create String variable we can store only String. -> String s  = "Welcome"
If we create boolean variable we can store only true/false. -> boolean b = true

But if we create Object type of variable this can hold any type of data. We can store integer,double, character, String,
boolean all kind of data is allowed in Object type of variable.
   Object x = Allowed all kind of data

Same thing for Arrays also:
If we create an array as int, we can store only integer values in Array.  -> int a=10
If we create an array as double, we can store only decimal numbers in Array.  -> double d=10.5
If we create an array as char, we can store only characters in Array.   -> char c ='A'
If we create an array as String, we can store only Strings.  -> String s  = "Welcome"

But if we create an array with object type we can store different type of data.
    Object a[] = {100,10.5,'A',"WELCOME",true};

Next how to read these data: 1. Using enhanced for loop 2. Using Normal for Loop

package Day06_Arrays;

public class Ex6_ObjectArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Object a[] = {100,10.5,'A',"WELCOME",true};
        //read the data using Enhanced for loop
/*

        for(Object x:a)
        {
        System.out.println(x);
        }
*/

        //read the data using normal for loop
        for (int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
        {
            System.out.println(a[i]);
        }
    }
}
