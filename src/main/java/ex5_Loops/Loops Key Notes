Loops: Loops are meant for repeating the set of statements. There are 4 types of loop in java.
 1. while loop
 2. do while loop
 3. for loop
 4. for each loop

 In this section we will learn about first 3 loops. And 4th type of loop we will learn while using collection.
 As for each loop/enhanced for loop is related to collection.

 Ex:
 1. If we have to find out GCD of some numbers then we have to go on subtracting the numbers.
 2. If I am finding LCM of some numbers, then I have to go on dividing the numbers with common factors,
 so it is not one step, we have to repeatedly do it more than one times. So, we have to do the similar
 work repeatedly more than one times. So, if when we have to do similar work repeatedly, then that we
 can put in the form of a loop.
