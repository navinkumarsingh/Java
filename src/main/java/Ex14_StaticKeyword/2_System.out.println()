System.out.println()
In Java, System.out.println() is a commonly used method to print information to the console.
Let’s try to understand with an example.

class Test
{
static String s="welcome";
}
Test.s.length()

In this example:
• Test is a class.
• s is a static string variable within the Test class with the value "welcome".
• The length() method is called on s, which returns the length of the string.
Similarly,
class System
{
 static PrintStream out;
}
System.out.println()
System.out.print()
Here’s what’s happening:
• System is a class provided by Java.
• out is a static variable of type PrintStream in the System class.
• The println() and print() methods belong to the PrintStream class.
