What is Java?
Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language used to build robust and secure applications.
It follows the OOP model (Object-Oriented Programming), meaning the code is structured around objects and classes.

Types of Programming Languages:
Structured Languages – Focus on logical, procedural flow (e.g., C, Python).
Object-Based Languages – Support some OOP concepts but lack inheritance (e.g., VBScript, Visual Basic).
Object-Oriented Languages – Fully support OOP features like inheritance and polymorphism (e.g., Java, C++, Python).

OOP Concepts in Java:
Class: Blueprint for creating objects.
Object: Instance of a class.
Inheritance: Derive new classes from existing ones.
Polymorphism: Use a single method in multiple forms.
Encapsulation: Hide internal details; expose only what's needed.
Abstraction: Focus on essential features while hiding complexity.


Core Java vs Advanced Java:
Core Java: Includes basics such as syntax, OOP, data structures, etc.
Advanced Java: Includes concepts like web applications, JDBC, and Servlets.

Java Features:
Platform-independent (write once, run anywhere).
Case-sensitive.
Strong memory management.
Robust exception handling.

Java Components:
JDK (Java Development Kit): For writing and compiling code.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): For running compiled applications.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes the bytecode.

Java Installation Tips:
Download JDK from official sources.
Set the JAVA_HOME path.
Use java -version in terminal/command prompt to verify setup.

Using Eclipse IDE:
Create a new Java project.
Add a package and a class.
Write your code and run it with a single click.

Naming Conventions in Java:
Class names start with a capital letter (e.g., StudentData).
Avoid special characters and starting names with numbers.
Use camelCase for variables and methods.

Comments in Java:
Single-line: // Comment here
Multi-line: /* Multiple lines of comments */


Common Keyboard Shortcuts in Eclipse:
syso + Ctrl+Space: Print statement auto-complete.
Ctrl+/: Comment or uncomment a line.
Ctrl+Shift+/: Multi-line comment.
