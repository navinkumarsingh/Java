# Java Programming for SDET - Learning & Practice

This repository is a comprehensive record of my self-driven journey to master Java for SDET roles, inspired by courses 
from Pavan Kumar and Abdul Bari, and enriched by my own research and hands-on practice.

## Highlights

- **Thorough coverage** of Java fundamentals: variables, data types, operators, control statements, loops, and methods, 
  each reinforced with practical assignments.
- **Deep dive into OOPs**, Collections (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`), File Handling, and real-world problem-solving.
- **All code is self-written, tested, and explained**â€”demonstrating my commitment to learning by doing.
- **Special focus on Arrays & Strings**: a dedicated folder with curated programs, solutions, and detailed explanations.
- **Well-organized structure**: topics progress from basics to advanced, with clear navigation, theory, and code samples.
- **Includes file handling and properties file examples** relevant for automation and real SDET scenarios.
