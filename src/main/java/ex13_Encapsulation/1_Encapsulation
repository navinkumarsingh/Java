Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods together into a single unit ‚Äî and that unit is
called a class.

In simple terms, it means restricting direct access to the data and allowing it to be accessed or modified only through
methods. This helps protect the data and ensures better control over how it is used.

üîê How do we achieve Encapsulation in Java?
1. All variables should be marked as private, so they can't be accessed directly from outside the class.
2. For each variable, we create getter and setter methods to read and modify the values.
3. This way, the variables can only be accessed and updated through methods, not directly.

‚úÖ Benefits of Encapsulation:
Improves security of data.
Makes the class easier to manage and maintain.
Provides controlled access to the data.
Helps in hiding the internal implementation details from the user.
