Detailed Explanation for All Programs

1️⃣ Identifying Positive or Negative Number
--------------------------------------------------
Scanner Class for User Input:
- Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); → Used to take integer input from the user.
- sc.nextInt(); → Reads an integer value.

Condition Used:
- if (num >= 0) → The number is positive (including zero).
- else → The number is negative.

Key Learning:
- The >= operator ensures that zero is treated as positive.

Edge Cases:
- 0 is considered positive in this logic.
- Works for both positive and negative numbers.

Example Cases:
- Input: 5 → Output: Positive.
- Input: -3 → Output: Negative.
- Input: 0 → Output: Positive.

Closing the Scanner:
- sc.close(); → Closes the scanner to avoid memory leaks.

--------------------------------------------------
2️⃣ Finding the Maximum of Three Numbers
--------------------------------------------------
Scanner Class for User Input:
- Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); → Used to take three integer inputs.

Condition Used:
- if (a > b && a > c) → a is the greatest.
- else if (b > c) → b is the greatest.
- else → c is the greatest.

Key Learning:
- The && (AND operator) helps compare multiple conditions.
- The program does not handle equal numbers (can be improved).

Example Cases:
- Input: a = 10, b = 5, c = 8 → Output: 10 is greatest.
- Input: a = 3, b = 7, c = 1 → Output: 7 is greatest.
- Input: a = 6, b = 6, c = 6 → Output: 6 is greatest.

Closing the Scanner:
- sc.close(); → Closes the scanner to avoid memory leaks.

--------------------------------------------------
3️⃣ Checking if a Number is Even or Odd
--------------------------------------------------
Scanner Class for User Input:
- Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); → Takes an integer input.

Condition Used:
- if (num % 2 == 0) → The number is Even.
- else → The number is Odd.

Key Learning:
- The % (modulus operator) helps check divisibility by 2.

Edge Cases:
- Negative numbers also follow the same rule.
- 0 is even because 0 % 2 == 0.

Example Cases:
- Input: 8 → Output: Even.
- Input: 13 → Output: Odd.
- Input: -4 → Output: Even.

Closing the Scanner:
- sc.close(); → Closes the scanner to avoid memory leaks.

--------------------------------------------------
4️⃣ Checking If a Person Is Young
--------------------------------------------------
Scanner Class for User Input:
- Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); → Takes a floating-point input for the age.

Age Classification Conditions:
- age >= 16 && age <= 55 → The person is considered young.
- Else → The person is not considered young.

Key Learning:
- Scanner class helps in taking user input.
- Comparison operators (>=, <=) check numerical conditions.
- Logical AND (&&) ensures both conditions are met together.
- Using float type allows for decimal inputs like 16.5 or 55.2.

Edge Cases Handled:
✅ Young Category (16 to 55 inclusive):
- Input: 16.0 → Output: "You are young!"
- Input: 30.5 → Output: "You are young!"
- Input: 55.0 → Output: "You are young!"

❌ Not Considered Young:
- Input: 15.9 → Output: "You are not considered young." (below 16)
- Input: 56.1 → Output: "You are not considered young." (above 55)
- Input: 100 → Output: "You are not considered young."

Closing the Scanner:
- sc.close(); → Closes the scanner to prevent resource leaks.

--------------------------------------------------
5️⃣ Finding Grade Based on Marks
--------------------------------------------------
Scanner Class for User Input:
- Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); → Takes marks as input.

Logic Used:
- Calculate average = (m1 + m2 + m3) / 3.
- Check grade based on range conditions:
  - > 70 → Grade A
  - 60-69 → Grade B
  - 50-59 → Grade C
  - 40-49 → Grade D
  - < 40 → FAIL

Key Learning:
- && operator is used to check range-based conditions.
- Casting (float) is needed to prevent integer division issues.

Example Cases:
- Input: Marks = 85 → Output: Grade A.
- Input: Marks = 62 → Output: Grade B.
- Input: Marks = 35 → Output: FAIL.

Closing the Scanner:
- sc.close(); → Closes the scanner to avoid memory leaks.

--------------------------------------------------
6️⃣ Identifying the Radix (Base) of a Number
--------------------------------------------------
Scanner Class for User Input:
- Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); → Takes a string input for number checking.

Condition Used (Regex Matching):
- [01]+ → Binary (Base 2) → Digits allowed: 0, 1.
- [0-7]+ → Octal (Base 8) → Digits allowed: 0-7.
- [0-9]+ → Decimal (Base 10) → Digits allowed: 0-9.
- [0-9A-Fa-f]+ → Hexadecimal (Base 16) → Digits: 0-9, A-F/a-f.

Key Learning:
- Regex (matches()) is useful for pattern-based conditions.
- Different numbering systems follow specific digit constraints.

Example Cases:
- Input: "1010" → Output: Binary.
- Input: "745" → Output: Octal.
- Input: "9876" → Output: Decimal.
- Input: "A1B3" → Output: Hexadecimal.

Closing the Scanner:
- sc.close(); → Closes the scanner to avoid memory leaks.

--------------------------------------------------
7️⃣ Checking If a Year Is a Leap Year
--------------------------------------------------
Scanner Class for User Input:
- Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); → Takes an integer input for the year.

Leap Year Conditions:
- Divisible by 4 → It may be a leap year.
- Divisible by 100 → It must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
- Divisible by 400 → It is a leap year.

Key Learning:
- % (modulus operator) helps determine divisibility.
- Nested if-else conditions help check multiple dependent conditions.

Edge Cases Handled:
✅ Leap Years:
- 1600, 2000, 2020, 2024 (divisible by 400 or by 4 but not 100).

❌ Not Leap Years:
- 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100 (divisible by 100 but not by 400).

🔹 Normal Years:
- 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021 (not divisible by 4).

Closing the Scanner:
- sc.close(); → Closes the scanner to avoid memory leaks.

--------------------------------------------------
8️⃣ Day Of Week Using If Else
--------------------------------------------------

Scanner Class for User Input:
- Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); → Creates a Scanner object to take input from the user.
- sc.nextInt(); → Reads an integer value entered by the user.

Condition Used:
- if(num == 1) → Sunday
- else if(num == 2) → Monday
- else if(num == 3) → Tuesday
- else if(num == 4) → Wednesday
- else if(num == 5) → Thursday
- else if(num == 6) → Friday
- else if(num == 7) → Saturday
- else → Not a valid number (handles cases where input is outside 1-7)

Key Learning:
- The program maps numbers (1-7) to days of the week using if-else conditions.
- If a number outside this range is entered, it prints "Not a valid number".

Edge Cases:
- If the user enters 0 or 8, it correctly identifies them as invalid.
- The program does not handle fractional inputs (e.g., 2.5) since nextInt() only accepts integers.

Example Cases:
- Input: 1 → Output: Sunday
- Input: 3 → Output: Tuesday
- Input: 7 → Output: Saturday
- Input: 8 → Output: Not a valid number
- Input: 0 → Output: Not a valid number

Closing the Scanner:
- sc.close(); → Closes the Scanner object to prevent memory leaks.

Alternative Approach:
- Using a switch statement instead of multiple if-else conditions would improve readability and efficiency.
