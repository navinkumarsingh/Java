public static void main(String[] args)
The public static void main(String[] args) method is the entry point of any standalone Java
application. Let's break down each part of this method to understand its significance:

1. public
• Access Modifier: public is an access modifier that makes the main method accessible from
anywhere. This is necessary because the Java runtime(JVM) needs to access this method to start
the application.

2. static
• Static Method: static means that the method belongs to the class, not instances of the class.
This allows the Java runtime to call the main method without creating an instance of the
class. Since main is the starting point of the program, it needs to be static so that it can be
called by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without needing to instantiate the class first.

3. void
• Return Type: void indicates that the main method does not return any value. The purpose of
main is to start the application, not to return data to the JVM.

4. main
• Method Name: main is the name of the method. This is a special method name in Java, and
the JVM looks for this method signature as the entry point when running a Java program.

5. String[] args
• Parameter: String[] args is an array of strings that stores command-line arguments passed
when the program is executed. If we run our Java program from the command line and
provide additional arguments, those arguments are passed as strings in this array.

• For example, if we run java MyClass arg1 arg2, then args will be an array containing ["arg1",
"arg2"].
• If no command-line arguments are provided, args will be an empty array
