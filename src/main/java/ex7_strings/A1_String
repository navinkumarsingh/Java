String (Definition): A String is a collection of characters. That are forming words or sentences or names or anything.
 i.e. collection of characters.

Simplest method for creating a String is:
            String str1 = "Java Program";


String Methods            Description

charAt()	              Get character at given index
concat()	              Combine ex7_strings
contains()	              Check if string contains substring
toCharArray()             returns the Strings in character of Array

 It is just like if we are declaring an integer type variable:
            int n =10;
     String is almost similar to above one. Like,
      int = Data Type.
      n = variable name.
      10 = Constant or a Literals.

 So, same way
  String is a Class Name here.
 str1 = variable but we call it as reference.
 variables of type Object we call it as reference.
 "Java Program" = String Object or String Literal.

 str1 is the reference holding the Object "Java Program".
 Or str1 is having the address of the Object. "Java Program".

Reference: The variable of type Class is called as Reference ans references are used of holding Objects or pointing
upon Objects.
