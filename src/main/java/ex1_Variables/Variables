ðŸ”¸ What is a Variable in Java?
In Java, a variable is like a container that stores data. It gives a name to a value so you can use and change that value in your program.

We can think of a variable like a labeled box where you store something â€” like a number, a word, or even a result of a calculation.

âœ… Types of Variables in Java:
1. Local Variables

Declared inside a method or block
Can be used only within that method or block
Must be initialized before use

2. Instance Variables (Non-static)

Declared inside a class but outside methods
Belong to each object (instance) of the class
Each object has its own copy

3. Static Variables (Class Variables)

Declared using the keyword static
Belong to the class itself, not individual objects
Shared across all instances of the class

ðŸ§ª Example:
public class Car {
    // Instance variable
    String color;

    // Static variable
    static int wheels = 4;

    void display() {
        // Local variable
        int speed = 60;
        System.out.println("Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Speed: " + speed);
        System.out.println("Wheels: " + wheels);
    }
}

ðŸ§  Remember:
Declaration: You must declare a variable before using it.
Example: int age = 25;

Variables have a data type (like int, String, boolean, etc.)

Variable names should be meaningful and follow Java naming rules.
