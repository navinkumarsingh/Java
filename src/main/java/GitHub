In IntelliJ IDEA, when you are using Git with GitHub, files in the project directory are color-coded based on their status in the Version Control System (VCS). Here's what each color means:
1️⃣ Green File (New File - Unversioned)
This means the file is newly created and has been added to Git but not committed yet.
The file is tracked by Git but is waiting to be committed.
Action Required: You need to commit the file.
2️⃣ White File (Unchanged - Committed)
The file is already committed and does not have any new changes.
It is in sync with the latest version in the repository.
No action required.
3️⃣ Blue File (Modified - Changed)
This file has been modified after the last commit.
It has changes that are not yet staged or committed.
Action Required: You can commit or discard changes.
Other File Colors in IntelliJ Git Integration:
Gray: Ignored by Git (.gitignore file).
Red: The file is untracked and not added to Git yet (git add needed).
