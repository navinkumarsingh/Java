Polymorphism
..................
Poly = Many
Morphism = Forms

Polymorphism means: One thing can exist or behave in many different forms.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What does it mean in simple terms?
Let’s understand with a couple of examples:

1. Shape Example:
The word Shape is a general term. There are many types of shapes:

A circle is one form of a shape.
A square is another.
A triangle, rectangle, and others are also different forms of shapes.
So, the concept of Shape represents many forms, which is a great example of polymorphism.

2. Water Example:
Water is a single substance, but it can exist in multiple forms:
It can be in the form of vapour (gas)
It can be in the form of liquid water
It can also take the form of ice, even shaped like an ice bulb
So again, one thing (water) can exist in many forms — another great example of polymorphism in the real world.

✅ In Java, we can achieve Polymorphism mainly through:

Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)
Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
