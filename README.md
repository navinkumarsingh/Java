# Java Programming for SDET - Learning & Practice

This repository is a comprehensive record of my self-driven journey to master Java for SDET roles, inspired by courses 
from Pavan Kumar and Abdul Bari, and enriched by my own research and hands-on practice.

## üîç Highlights
**Thorough coverage of Java fundamentals:**
Variables, data types, operators, control statements, loops, methods, arrays, strings, object-oriented programming (OOPs), classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, interfaces, exception handling, collections (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap), file handling, and properties files ‚Äî each reinforced with practical assignments.

**Hands-on learning:**
All code is self-written, tested, and well-commented, demonstrating my commitment to learning by doing.

**Focused deep dives:**
Special emphasis on Arrays and Strings ‚Äî with a dedicated folder of curated programs, solutions, and detailed explanations.

**Well-organized structure:**
Topics progress from basic to advanced, with clear navigation, theory notes, and code samples.

**Real-world relevance:**
Includes file handling and properties file examples applicable to automation and real SDET scenarios.

**In-depth explanations:**
Each topic is supported by thorough notes, and every line of code includes detailed logic commentary.

## üôè Acknowledgements
Gratitude to **Abdul Bari**, **Pavan Kumar**, and the broader Java community for foundational resources and inspiration that guided this learning path.
