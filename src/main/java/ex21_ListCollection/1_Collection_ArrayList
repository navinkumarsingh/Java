Collections - ArrayList
Collection
• In Java, a collection represents a group of objects, often referred to as elements.
• Collections provide a way to store, manipulate, and retrieve data in a more organized
manner.
• These collections are part of the Java Collection Framework.
• Java collections can only store object types (i.e., reference types such as String, Integer, etc.),
and cannot store primitive types (e.g., int, char).
• To store primitive types, Java provides Wrapper classes (like Integer for int, Double for
double, etc.).
• Java provides different types of collections, each with its specific use cases. Common
collections include:
o List: Stores elements in an ordered sequence (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
o Set: Stores unique elements without any particular order (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).
o Map: Stores key-value pairs (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).
• Iterable and Collection are root interfaces in the Java Collection Framework
Hierarchy of Collection Framework:

ArrayList
1. ArrayList is implemented List interface.
2. Heterogeneous Data
An ArrayList can store both homogeneous (same type) and heterogeneous (different types)
data. However, if generics are used, it is typically constrained to homogeneous types.
a. Example without generics: ArrayList list = new ArrayList(); – can store different types
like String, Integer, Double, etc.
b. Example with generics: ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList< String >(); – can store
only String elements.
3. Duplicate Elements Allowed
An ArrayList allows duplicate elements. You can add the same object multiple times, and it
will be stored as individual elements.
4. Maintains Insertion Order
An ArrayList maintains the insertion order of elements. The order in which elements are
added will be the order in which they are retrieved.
5. Indexing Support
ArrayList supports index-based access to its elements. You can access, update, or remove
elements using their index positions.
a. Example: list.get(0); – retrieves the element at index 0.
6. Multiple Nulls Allowed
An ArrayList allows storing multiple null values. There is no restriction on the number of null
elements.
