Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where code and data
are wrapped together into a single unit.
This mechanism ensures that sensitive data is hidden from the outside world and only accessible
through controlled methods.
Key Points:
1. All Variables Should Be Private:
All the class variables should be declared as private, ensuring that they are not directly accessible from outside the
class.
2. Getters and Setters for Each Variable:
For each private variable, provide two methods:
▪ Getter Method: A method to retrieve the value of the variable.
▪ Setter Method: A method to set or update the value of the variable.
3. Variables Operated Only Through Methods:
Variables should be accessed and modified only through these getter and setter
methods, ensuring that any operation on the data is controlled and secure.
Example Code:
Example to demonstrate encapsulation: Ex1_Account
Example Explained
• Private Variable:
o The name variable is private, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside the
Person class.
• Getter Method:
o getName() is used to retrieve the value of name.
• Setter Method:
o setName(String newName) is used to set or update the value of name. The this
keyword is used to refer to the current object's instance variable.

Accessing Private Variables
In a different class, you cannot directly access the private variables:
Example to demonstrate accessing the private variables: Ex1_AccountMain
